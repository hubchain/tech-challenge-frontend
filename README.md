# Hubchain Frontend Tech Challenge

Hey Front-End developer. Welcome.

To protect the world from vilains are hero's mission! Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to carve out up to 16 hours and create a single page application (SPA) to build up the best team using [Disney Marvel's Amazing API](https://developer.marvel.com/). Your application should show a random vilain to be defeated and then allow a registered user to create an awesome 3-to-7 hero team.

> **Hey this is important!**
