# Hubchain Frontend Tech Challenge

Hey Front-End developer. Welcome. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to carve out 16 hours and create a single page app (SPA) using the [Blockchain Developer API](https://www.blockchain.com/api).

> **Hey this is important!**
> We hope you can spend about 8 hours on this project. If you can finish faster -- great! If not, limit yourself and don't spend much longer than 16 hours MAX.

Our developers are struggling to track Bitcoin's price so they can buy or sell it. As you know a developer's day is quite busy, so they need find out the best moment to make their move.

Your application should allow the developer to register his buy price and let him know how much he had won (or lose).  Use the [Blockchain Developer API](https://www.blockchain.com/api) in order to display the Bitcoin rate in BRL and USD.

The web app must consist of a login page, a page where the user can register/watch his entries and a page where he can see the list of prices returned from Blockchain.

## Requirements for a valid solution
- Readme explaining how to run the project
- You can start it from scratch or use a bootstrap project
- It must be a Single Page Application
- It must be implemented with AngularJS
- Include tests (at least unit tests)
- It should be responsive
- Modularize whenever possible, avoid monster components
- The accepted credentials for the login page are any hubchain email address ( i.e. yourname@hubchain.com) the password "hubchain".


## Nice to have
- Static typed javascript
- Linted code
- Custom design like the logo and banners, do not forget to send us the original file (psd, ai, etc)
- Anything else you would like to add

## when you are finished
- Please send your solution as a github repository link to tech.challenge@hubchain.com
- also please don't fork this repo as other candidates could then start build on top of your solution ;-)
